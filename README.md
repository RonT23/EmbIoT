## Purpose
This project is part of the final assignment for the course *"Multiprocessing Systems in Integrated Circuits"* in the Masterâ€™s Program in *"Computer Engineering"* at the National and Kapodistrian
University of Athens, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications.

## Objective
This project involves the design and deployment of an embedded IoT application for monitoring air temperature and relative humidity, on an *ESP32*-based development platform to read data from a *DHT22* sensor and communicate wirelessly via Wi-Fi to a remote server using the *MQTT* protocol. 

## Documentation
Details on the design and implementation of the system can be found in `EmbIoT_final_reportV1.0.pdf` located in the `./docs/` folder. For further information, please contact me at `rontsela@mail.ntua.gr` or `ron-tsela@di.uoa.gr`.
